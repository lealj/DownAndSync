# Downloads and stores "Youtube liked videos" in a directory structure, compatible with Plex Media Server.

### The program currently has two main features:
1. Automates the downloading of Youtube videos' audio, by gathering your liked videos on Youtube, and downloading them in bulk.
2. Automates the downloading of any newly liked Youtube videos' audio, through an optional sync process, that runs every X minutes.

The downloads are structured in a way that is compatible with Plex Media Server, as it follows the Artist/Album/song.ext format.

### Planned features:
1. Add compatibility for Spotify to Plex Media Server.
2. Allow transferring music between Youtube to Spotify and vice versa.
